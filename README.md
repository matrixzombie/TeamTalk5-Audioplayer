# TeamTalk5-Audioplayer
An audio player for the team talk 5 conferencing system.
## Requirements for windows with cygwin:
mplayer, ffmpeg. Place in a folder called bin in your cygwin home/username directory.
Also you will need to place the cmdquence.exe in the bin directory as well for the eloquence speech.
Install apt-cyg for cygwin. running ./player install will take care of the rest.
## Requirements for linux:
Should run find on linux but if any packages are missing just take a look at the code.
Thanks for using!
